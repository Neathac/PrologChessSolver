# PrologChessSolver
A university semestral project

At the moment, the chess simulation doesn't support:
 - castling moves
 - pawns switching out at the end of the board
 - En passant

The current move search only finds mate in 1 moves

To start the chess simulation, consult the chess.pl file and call start. predicate. The code will instruct you afterwards.
